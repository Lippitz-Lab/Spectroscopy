Four-wave mixing on a gold surface
(Measurements by Christoph Schnupfhagn)


1) fwm_spectrum.dat

The file has 3 columns: Wavelength, excitation spectrum, FWM spectrum.
The absolute values are arbitrary. 

Predict the FWM spectrum from the excitation spectrum!


2) Linear phase shift

The excitation spectrum is now rectangular with two rectangles centered at 720 nm and 820 nm. In the "narrow" form the rectangles are 10 nm wide, in the "wide" form they are 20 nm wide. The laser light at the low (variant 1) or high (variant 2) wavelength is now given a linear phase response by a pulse shaper, i.e. phi(t) = d_phi * t. An FWM spectrum is measured for each value of d_phi. The file linphase.dat contains the values of d_phi (unit fs), the file wl.dat contains the wavelength axis of the FWM spectrum (unit nm). The files fwm_FORM_VARIANT.dat contain the actual data.

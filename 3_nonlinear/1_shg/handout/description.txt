SHG on plasmonic nanostructures

The files contain the results of numerical simulations (COMSOL, Julian Obermeier). The electric field in the plane z=0 along the surface of a nanostructure is calculated when illuminated along the z-axis. The extent of the structure in z-direction is 30 nm, i.e. from z=+15 nm to z=-15 nm.

The columns contain
* X coordinate (nm)
* Y coordinate (nm)
* Real(E_x)
* Imag (E_x)
* Real(E_y)
* Imag (E_y)
* Real(E_z)
* Imag (E_z)

The filename specifies the wavelength in nm and the polarization direction. The absolute value of the electric field is arbitrary.

Plot the field distribution and the nonlinear polarization P^(2). Calculate the efficiency with which SHG should be detected in the far field. At what nanostructure size does this become direction dependent?

PS: See Matlab quiver plot or other methods to visualize a vector field.

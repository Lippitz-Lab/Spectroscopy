\section{Rayleigh scattering of small spheres}


In this chapter, we change our point of view a little bit. We consider small, mostly spherical, incusings of material with one dielectric function in an enviroenmnet with another dielectric function. At the end, we will make the connection to molecules and nanocrystals, but for the moment we stay with classical electrodynanics.
